# TextMate Support for the Vala Programming Language

This bundle provides [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) syntax highlighting, code completion, etc. for the 
TextMate text editor.

# Getting Vala on the Mac

The easiest way to get Vala on the Mac is to use Homebrew and run
the following:

    $ brew install vala

LibGee is strongly suggested:

    $ brew install libgee

This will install all you need to begin working with Vala.
